  Cost symbols (R/B/U/G/W) should have images
Importing
  Look into existing Magic TG CSVs that we might use to import a giant card database

Deck Builder
  Two panes: list of cards available and list of cards in the deck

Done!
  Write edit/update for cards
  Change order of card entry form to kind of match the card's layout
  There should be a drop-down for color (red/white/blue/green/black/artifact/colorless/gold/whatever)
  Display flavor text if it's there
  Display type
  Display sub_type
  Added a list of valid card_types (and a drop-down for same in the card form)
  Added a deck controller with CRUD actions
