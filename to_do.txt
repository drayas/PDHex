Creating a card
  Change order of card entry form to kind of match the card's layout
  There should be a drop-down for color (red/white/blue/green/black/artifact/colorless/gold/whatever)
Index
  Display flavor text if it's there
  Display type
  Display sub_type
  Cost symbols (R/B/U/G/W) should have images
Write edit/update for cards
Look into existing Magic TG CSVs that we might use to import a giant card database
